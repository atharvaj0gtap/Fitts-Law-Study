# Fitts-Law-Study

For this study, the goal was to compare two different input methods: a trackpad (Input Method 1) and a mouse (Input Method 2). These input methods were analyzed based on their performance in a task that required participants to interact with different targets. The task was designed according to the Fitts' Law model, which relates movement time (MT) to the index of difficulty (ID).
